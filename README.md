# hvsr_analysis
Fundamental frequency of a site using eHVSR and mHVSR


# Background
### This project goal is to conduct Horizontal to Vertical Spectral Ratio (HVSR) analysis proposed by Nogoshi & Igarashi (1971) and Nakamura (1989) to estimate fundemental frequency (f0) of a site. There have been existing literature to validate the authenticity of f0 to its physics-based accuracy. Therefore, we wish to examine the deriation of f0 using statistics. Our goal is to develope a relationship between basin amplification in seismic ground motion models using f0 derived from HVSR analysis

* The project utilizes HVSRPy package developed by John Vantessel. Please refer to their documentation for more information [HVSRPy](https://github.com/jpvantassel/hvsrpy)

* To eradicate the effect of altitude in seismic recordings, we decide to choose 10 stations which is denoted as **ground** from [Strong Motion Database](https://www.strongmotioncenter.org/)
and 5 earthquakes with magnitudes of 4 or greater

* We are under development to establish a framework for our analysis. Our first step is to gather data using `obspy` and analyze data using `hvsrpy`. Data is retrieved in waveforms format by `obspy`. Waveforms generated by earthquake radiation are categorized as **eHVSR** and waveforms generated by ambient noises are categorized as **mHVSR**.
