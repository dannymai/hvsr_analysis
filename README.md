# hvsr_analysis

## Overview
My first year in PhD Civil Engineering program at University of Southern California, I was in charge of _Analysis of Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectra Ratio (HVSR) to identify a site fundamental frequency using 1D Ground Response Analysis_. My exploratory work has led to conclusion of HVSR potential in predicting site amplification. The advantage of HVSR is its mobility and standardized processing tools comparing to subsurface investigaton reports. For example, at sites where shear wave ($V_s$) velocity profile is not available, a 2-hour seismometer deployment are thought to be sufficient to generate an estimate of $V_s$ profile with approximate substrate alteration based on HVSR Spectra peaks. The peak identification is in the process of getting verified using 1D ground response analysis. Initial research shows that theoretical transfer function peaks are co-located with HVSR peaks. 

## Background
Horizontal to Vertical Spectral Ratio (HVSR) analysis proposed by Nogoshi & Igarashi (1971) and Nakamura (1989) is a method to estimate fundemental frequency (f0) of a site. 

* The project utilizes HVSRPy package developed by John Vantessel. Please refer to their documentation for more information [HVSRPy](https://github.com/jpvantassel/hvsrpy)

* To eradicate the effect of altitude in seismic recordings, 10 "ground" stationsfrom [Strong Motion Database](https://www.strongmotioncenter.org/)
and 5 earthquakes with magnitudes of 4 or greater. The ground station is identified as 0ft elevation or below ground station. 

* We are under development to establish a framework for our analysis. Our first step is to gather data using `obspy` and analyze data using `hvsrpy`. Data is retrieved in waveforms format by `obspy`. Waveforms generated by earthquake radiation are categorized as **eHVSR** and waveforms generated by ambient noises are categorized as **mHVSR**.
